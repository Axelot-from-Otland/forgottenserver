Known Bugs:

*skull in protect zone ,if you throw some field and enter pz ,you will get white skull if someone step in the field
*crash related to login(i am only able to reproduce this if i login with the host machine): https://otland.net/threads/crash-tfs-1-2-downgraded-by-ninja.258451/#post-2544655
*runes stack inside full containers bug ,there is a workaround for this , but it's still a bug : https://otland.net/threads/tfs-1-2-runes-on-container.262139/#post-2535403
 (workaround for this bug is : remove attribute key="type" value="rune" from all runes in items.xml ,change the runes properties to stackable in Tibia.SPR with object builder, and reload the atributes of items.otb with some itemeditor)
